Is there such a thing like free speech?
Should there be one?

First, I think that the term *free speech* is misleading.
It can imply that speech is free, in the sense that there
are no consequences to saying something, or that saying
something doesn't come with a price.
For example, if I tell a friend of mine that I don't like the
dinner (s)he made, I might not be invited next time.
In that case, I payed with something for my speech -- I gave up a
subsequent invitation to a potentially excellent dinner.
In general, every time you say something, it causes a reaction in other people,
one which may be favourable or unfavourable for you.
There is no such thing as a free lunch -- you always pay
some price and there is always a consequence to what you say
(unless you're talking to yourself in an empty room, but even that's
[open for debate](/home/thoughts)).

Therefore, I think a better term is *freedom of speech*,
because it implies that there are no legal repercussions,
social or individual retribution for communicating
one's thoughts and ideals.

So, is there such a thing as freedom in speech?

Most (western) countries today boast a near-absolute freedom of speech.
But is this really so in practice?
In truth, Western culture seems to show a growing trend of decline in the freedom
of speech.
There's a recent, great article by Jonathan Turly I recommend on this topic called
"Shut up and play nice: How the western world is limiting free speech".
He says:

> The much-misconstrued statement of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes that free
> speech does not give you the right to shout "Fire!" in a crowded theater is now
> being used to curtail speech that might provoke a violence-prone minority.
> Our entire society is being treated as a crowded theater, and talking about
> whole subjects is now akin to shouting "Fire!".

The thesis is that the modern society cannot tolerate any kind of speech
that might challenge a certain group's opinion or values (think about feminism,
religion, homosexuality, certain racial or ethnic groups, etc.).
These opinions and values are for some reason legitimate and
unquestionable solely on the basis that they exist.
In the same time, challenging the accepted political values, doctrines
and social taboos is exactly what freedom of speech is supposed
to be about.

Speaking of taboos, the western culture has its share of them.
Capitalism is the best social system, there's little doubt about that,
and socialism is a synonim for a totalitarian, dictatorship society.
Saying that the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings are war crimes because
they had unnecessary civilian casulties can get you into trouble
(even though [this was confirmed later](http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig2/denson7.html)).
While the holocaust done by the Nazis during World War II is shunned upon by most,
it is not a good idea to say that a holocaust is being committed in Palestine today.
You better watch your ass.

As for legal repercussions, there is no absolute legal protection either.
Freely sharing important news and information with the public seems to go hand-in-hand
with dubious accusations about sexual assaults these days.
If you're lucky, you can end up sitting confined in an Ecuadorian embassy for doing
these things.

In fact, there's even a backdoor in the international human rights law,
which says that the free speech may not be exercised in situations where it
could compromise things like national security, respect or reputation of others,
or public order ([ICCPR, Article 19](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech)).
This is a very shaky statement, as it allows different interpretations of what
respect, reputation or security actually are.
These different subjective interpretations can be taken advantage of in
different circumstances, like in a court.

Did you watch the movie *Postman*, an adaptation of a novel by David Brin?
If not, skip this paragraph and put that movie on your to-do list.
Or, even better, read the novel.
I should, as well.
If you've seen the movie, maybe you remember a guy leading a neo-fascist army of Holnists,
raiding towns and calling himself general Bethlehem.
He was portrayed as a highly intelligent and knowledgeable individual,
and in the same time a megalomaniac.
You may also recall how he loses his temper when he hears about the attempt
to restore the postal service, hence allowing the divided towns to
start communicating and exchanging information.
He was well-aware that communication enables the spread of knowledge,
and knowledge is the best weapon against fear, something that the Holnists
used to control and exploit the population for a long time.

There is sense behind the words:

> The pen is mightier than the sword.
>
> Edward Bulwer-Lytton

There are many examples in history where those in power attempted
to stop the spread of knowledge.
Inquisition or Internet censorship in some countries are just some of them.
The bottomline is, to maintain control and order sometimes it's necessary to limit certain rights.
This is nothing new and is well-known as the *social contract* -- individuals surrender some
of their rights and freedoms in exchange for the protection of the remaining ones.
What the rights are exactly depends on the time, culture, region and so on.
To think that we are somehow *different* or *better* today than the people two hundred years
ago is misguided.
We have our own set of taboos, restraints and limitations in perceiving the world,
it's just that we're not aware of them in the day-to-day life.

As a conclusion to the first question from the beginning, there is no *free* speech.
There is a certain degree of *freedom* of speech, which depends largely on the perceived
controversy of the speech itself.
The problem with this freedom is that controversy usually makes at least somebody unhappy,
and the modern society seems to be unable to tolerate something like that, for whatever reason.

It's interesting to see that the emphasis on what is being said is so great today
with the information saturation effect overflowing everybody with so much facts
that nobody seems to care anymore.
Perhaps this is exactly why the society/system cares -- with the ability to spread ideas so easily with the help of
technology, the bar on who gets to say what has to be adjusted, so that the intended information can reach everyone.
In any case, I've been ranting for far too long about the first question.

Now comes a more controversial question, one that I personally find much more interesting.
Should everyone have an equal right to freedom in speech?

The problem with this question is the "should" part,
because "should" doesn't really mean anything.
The reason why it does not mean anything is because it
has no context.
The proper question is "Should everyone have an equal right to freedom in speech in order to \[INSERT-EFFECT-HERE\]?".
In other words, we have to define what the desired effect is,
only then does the question make sense.

So, lets imagine that the intended effect is global social happiness.
Most people will agree on that.
But, what does global social happiness even mean?
How do you even measure happiness of an individual?
Global social happiness could be something like the average hapiness
in the entire society.
How you would measure this escapes me.
Although this remains a moot point, we can still roughly disambiguate
the global social happiness of several groups -- e.g. a group of schoolkids
about to go on a field trip is happier than a group of prisoners being lead
to an execution (though I've been on a few pretty bad field trips in
my days).
We don't really need to measure global social happiness precisely -- just
comparing several alternative groups will do for this discussion.

With the intended effect in mind, the answer is: No.

In general, whenever there is a claim starting with a "for all", meaning
in all cases some statement should be true, it's much easier to disprove
such a claim if it's incorrect, than it is to prove that it is correct.
Why?
Because to prove it you have to show that the statement is true for all
the cases.
To disprove it you need to find at least a single case when it
isn't -- this is called a counterexample.
In general, when assessing if some claim is true, you should first look for
counterexamples, because that's easier.
This is something we mostly do anyway.
And lucky for me, the claim that if everyone has an equal right to speech 
optimal global hapiness will be achieved has a hidden "for all" in it.
This "for all" quantifies over all the things people might say.

So, let me give a couple of counterexamples.
First, I've been ranting on and on about how modern society condemns any
kind of hate speech.
This kind of rule of the thumb makes sense.
Humans are incredibly susceptible to what they hear.
<img src="/resources/images/skinheads.jpg" class="imageinline"/>
Ideas can be very powerful, and are easily picked up.
Verbally spreading hate against a certain group can quickly spark more
hatred.
Young people are a particularly fertile ground for these kind of
ideas, since they lack experience, self-confidence and are unsure
of their goals in life.
On the image on the left you can see a schoolbook example of a group
of [skinhead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinhead#Racism.2C_anti-racism_and_politics) youngins.
The one in the middle is even holding a bottle and enjoying his
fine alcoholic beverage.
Unless you sanction this group's actions, they will spread their
views further, grow their impact in the society and attain
more recruits.
Once they reach a critical mass, they will start executing their
ideas by spreading violence at the targeted groups.
Streets will become less safe, people will get hurt.
The global social happiness level will become lower, and lower is definitely
not optimal.

If reaching optimal global happiness is the desired effect,
then people like these shouldn't have their say.

Another example are referendums.
I consider this a form of speech, since you very precisely state your opinion
in a referendum (that is, if you manage to correctly fill out the ballot paper).
Lets say that there's a referendum for building a nuclear power plant
near some city.
With all the anti-nuclear power propaganda that we can see these days,
it's only natural that most inhabitants of the city would vote against.
Add a couple of hot-shot local activists and you can kiss your
nuclear power plant goodbye.
Instead, the people of the city decide to build a coal power plant -- which
may be more expensive, but at least they won't get radiated.
The fact that their air will be polluted so much that the average
life expectancy will go down by 10% is only secondary.
Lets assume that this results in a decrease of global happiness -- after
all, you want to see your loved ones for as long as possible.
Perhaps that nuclear power plant was a better option.
If so, it would have made more sense to require that a voter understands
the risks and consequences of both alternatives well, before allowing
him to actually vote.

In general, a vote should be more valuable if the voter is an expert
in the field in question.
Experts have a higher probability of reaching the correct decision
individually, so giving a higher voting weight to experts increases
the probability of reaching a decision which increases global happiness.
The math behind this is simple.

Rest assured -- in achieving the optimal global social happiness,
it's best that some people just don't say anything at all.

But, if that's so, why is everyone's vote equally important then?
There is one problem we've overlooked here.
How do we know which weights to assign to voters?
How do we know which kind of behaviours to sanction?
How do we know what kind of speech should be forbidden?
In some very obvious examples, this is straightforward and most
reasonable individuals will quickly reach a consensus, but in most
cases we don't know the answers to these questions at all.

The problem is that the human society has no *objective arbiter*.
The only potential arbiters are the individuals in the human society
itself, ones that should themselves be governed and no individual is
intelligent or unbiased enough to act as an arbiter.
In fact, totalitarian and dictatorship systems usually haven't done so well
in the past precisely for this reason -- it's extremely difficult, probably
impossible to find a proper arbiter.

There is a nice analogy to [Turing machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) here.
Every Turing machine can execute any program.
However, no Turing machine can decide if another Turing machine
will ever finish executing a program, or continue executing it forever.
Knowing an answer to this would require a hypothetical oracle device
which can decide if a program ever ends or executes forever.
Programmers have developed heuristics, approximation mechanisms, that
are able to only approximately answer if the programs executes forever
or not.

Different societies, unable to find a proper arbiter (or oracle), apply different
heuristics in deciding what's good or bad for achieving optimal global hapiness.
The heuristic that the society applies today (at least, boasts applying) is that of equality.
The advantage of this heuristic is that it appears to largely drive
the society towards the global happiness optimum, since everyone votes in his own interest
(even though people don't always know what is best for themselves).
This isn't the only heuristic ever applied -- in the past the rule was passed from
one generation of rulers to the next, probably based on the assumption that
an excellent *arbiter* has a genetic predisposition to produce excellent *arbiter*
offspring for the next generation
([we saw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_intermarriage#Inbreeding) how well that turned out).
Perhaps in the future we will see more refined and more complex heuristics that lead
to optimal global happiness with mathematical models backing them up.

In my personal view, the fundamental problem is not that people should limit what they say,
it's that they should instead learn how to selectively ignore what others are saying.
If you hear something you could interpret as an insult, you don't really have to
react on it.
It's safe to ignore it.

Also, in most situations you're better of not saying anything at all and,
amazingly, you can get very far by not sharing your opinion at all.
This is interesting, because although freedom of speech is possibly
important for the society as a whole, for an individual it could be mostly
irrelevant -- often you're just better off keeping your mouth shut.

So let me end this with a short quote:
