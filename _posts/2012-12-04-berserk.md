I recently (finally) watched the anime series based on a popular manga
called Berserk.
It's a short anime series, having only 26 episodes, and it's also somewhat
old -- it's been released back in 1997.
A couple of my friends mentioned it, referring to it as violent and bloody,
but all of them agreed it was excellent.
This intrigued me and I wondered what was so excellent about an anime
based purely on violence.

The thing's been on my queue for a while, so I turned it on one Saturday.
I didn't really figure out the first episode, so I let it hang until
Sunday morning when I started watching the second episode.
I can only tell you one thing -- I was pinned to the couch for the next 14 hours
or so, barely taking the time to go grab a snack from the fridge once or twice.
I watched the thing in that Sunday in one go, no breaks.

Berserk is possibly the best anime I ever saw.
So, before you continue reading this post, I recommend that you
go and watch Berserk.
Even if you're not into this sort of thing, you might like it
(oh, and in case I haven't told you this before -- you should always
watch anime in original Japanese audio track).
Plus, there could be some spoilers below.
If you're even remotely interested, you should watch this on your own,
draw your own set of conclusions and observations.
I'm serious.
You were warned.

So, what's this all about?
The story in Berserk revolves around a wandering swordsman named Guts
that one day ends up joining a group of mercenaries lead by a charismatic,
highly intelligent individual named Griffith.
Guts is a typical example of a lone wolf -- a character who bears no allegiance,
follows no leader, cares about no authority (yeah, that's the jolly fellow
you can see on the image above).
He has no friends, no family, only his sword.
Although he is highly skillful, he doesn't think far ahead, he's quick get agitated
and draw the weapon, and his fighting style is reckless.
His life is a life of discipline, stoicism and no particular goal other than
to fight as a hired sword.

> Griffith

So, there is little wonder in his initial resistance to join the mercenary group
and reluctance to accept them, enlarged by the fact that he is forced to join them.
This, however, changes over time and Guts grows to appreciate the cameraderie they
share and share the respect others have for Griffith.
He makes some friends, as well as some enemies.
With Griffith's skillful leadership, and with no small help from Guts,
the mercenary group slowly works their way into the royal guard, and a large
part of the anime describes what happens to them along the way.

Griffith is an extraordinary leader almost to the point of being cliche.
Everything he does, he does with a measure, there are no mistakes, he is as
precise in combat as he is in dealing with people, be it his subordinates,
his employers or his adversaries.
This deadly precision and cold determination follow his character everywhere.
His emotions are always in check, he never slips, everything he says seems
weighted and carefully chosen.
His eyes rarely smile, and even when he laughs he seems to be under control.

But, there is more to Griffith than meets the eye.
While it may seem at first that he is merely an excellent strategist and an
excellent leader for no reason at all, it soon becomes apparent that there is
a deeper cause behind Griffith's persona.
Early on in the anime, Griffith lightheartedly hints to Guts about what he wants.
This desire, this dream he has, is something that determined Griffith's nature.

> A dream can fortify a man’s life, or it can bring suffering upon it.
> A dream can make a man feel alive, or it can kill him instead.
> Even if a man is abandoned by that dream, part of it will remain smouldering in his heart.
>
> Griffith

As the anime progresses, the initially mystical aura surrounding him is gradually
lifted, to reveal a person deeply obsessed with a dream he aspires to make
reality at any cost.
In this aspiration, he treats everything he encounters as an obstacle on the path to this
goal, his enemies, his mercenary band, even his friends.
This dream serves as a driving force for his existence.
The dream is what shapes him, what allowes to him to rise to the heights that he is at.
"Strive for nothing, and you stay nothing".
<img src="/resources/images/griffith-caska.png" class="imageinline"/>
And seeing everything as means to achieving his own dream is not an understatement.
He is unable to empathize with anybody, he is cold and things only about his own gains.
Even when he shows warmth, it always seems to be calculated and with a goal.
This Machiavellian aspiration, however, isolates him from everybody else and
leaves him as lonely as Guts is a loner.
His pursuit leaves him utterly alone, even though surrounded by his soldiers,
allies, enemies and so many other people.
Those who attempt to become close are mostly people in his own mercenary band
which follow him blindly, without question, people who are ready to die for him
and for his own vision.
Nevertheless, Griffith always keeps a distance from these people.
While he cares and watches over them, he never becomes close to them -- he cannot
allow himself to show emotion, weakness or his human side.
Yet, even though he tends to show little emotions, his reliance in Guts and a secret
desire for someone he could regard as his own equal become apparent as the
story progresses.

> In my eyes, a true friend is someone who never clings to another’s dream.
> Someone independent who can find his own reason to live and follow that path without guidance.
> And if anyone tries to crush his dream, protect it heart and soul.
> Even if that person happened to be me.
> <br/>
> For me, a true friend is someone whom I consider my equal.
>
> Griffith

Even a heart seemingly as cold and inhuman as Griffith's, deprived of all emotions 
needed one thing in the end -- love.
Love that could overcome the loneliness he felt, that allowed him to open
his soul to another.
He came to love Guts, because he saw an individual willing to follow and protect his
own dream, rather than clinge to another man's dream -- in him he saw himself.
He loved Guts, because "to know one is to love one", and he wanted love from
Guts, because "to be loved is to be understood".
And this is the ultimate conflict in Griffith's soul.
Griffith had a dream of a kingdom and nothing would stand in his way, not until
he met Guts.
It is the conflict between love and the dream.
Submit to love, and you will forgo your dream, forget it, but still let it smoulder
forever in your heart.
Follow your dream, and you denounce love, remaining lonely in your trek.
This conflict, this choice, is something we all share more or less.
Dream, which gives meaning to existence, which is the driving force of life, is
in the same time a source of suffering, a curse cast upon you from the moment the
dream comes to you, whether you decide to follow it or not.
Ironically, it is the very dream that shapes that also destroys a man's soul.
And how wonderfully is this portrayed in the Griffith character!

This dilemma between the love and the dream, between submitting to peaceful and mundane,
and remaining loyal to one's vision is present in many places later in the anime.
And these questions carry a paramount weight in Berserk.
Is there a choice between the love and the dream?
Is the choice absolute, are the two mutually exclusive?
Or is there a middle ground?
Can you submit to love, without yielding your dream?

> If you desire one thing for so long, it’s a given that you’ll miss other things along the way. 
> That’s how it is... that’s life.
> 
> Godo

The most fervent followers of their dreams sometimes falter.
Sooner or later, one has to pay the price of sacrificing everything
else for a dream.
That price is called regret.
When Griffith reached the top, Griffith realized he had nothing.
Perhaps this is the ultimate message in this anime -- if you focus
too much on the goal, you will miss out too much along the way,
a similar message to the [one in Cavafy's poem](/home/ithaca/).
The tragic fate that meets Griffith in the second part of the series
illustrates this in a very dramatic twist.
Perhaps an even better evidence of this unavoidable regret is Griffith's
dream at the very end of the anime.

Even though the main protagonist of this anime seems to be Guts, Griffith is
is beyond any doubt the most complex character.
Guts (at least in the anime, I didn't read the manga yet) is relatively plain
and flat.
Guts is simple, where Griffith is conflicted.
And this simplicity, the absence of an obsession with a dream,
is in the same time his blessing.
His dream is very different, it's like "forging a perfect sword".

> While some dreams can be pursued alone, some are like storms, blowing apart
> hundreds or thousands of other dreams as they go.

> Griffith

There are other characters, most notable of which is Caska, a female warrior in
the mercenary group whose past has made her harsh and difficult.
Her undivided loyalty contrasted with her hidden love for Griffith makes her a
conflicted character, quick to develop hatred towards Guts to whom Griffith shows
so much, in her view undeserved, affection.
Although she is closest to being Griffith's friend, even being close to him at one
point where he briefly breaks and shows emotion, in her admiration and respect towards
Griffith she's, just like so many others, unable to truly be his friend -- she cannot
be his equal.
And even though her love for Griffith is unquestionable from the start,
he is unable to accept it, since he feels that he can only be loved,
understood by those who are his equals in everything.
While he is fully aware of this love, and a part of him even desires to accept it
as is hinted at the very end of the anime, the dilemma of setting aside his dream
prevents him from doing so.

There's no doubt that Berserk is full of violence, blood and gore,
sometimes deeply disturbing scenes of murder, death and rape.
But Berserk is not about that at all.
This is merely a facade, a realistic illustration of the medieval-like setting
in which the story takes place, the fantastic component of which becomes
more apparent towards the end.
The real value is hidden in character portrayals and their interactions,
as well as hidden messages imbued throughout the anime,
coloured with occassional light-hearted humour.
Once you get into the story and the characters, brutal, violent scenes become
pretty secondary to that.
I feel pity for anybody discarding such a work of art over, such abundance
of hidden messages and meanings over something as trivial as the form in
which these are conveyed.

In fact, the violent and brutal surface of Berserk is precisely what makes
it so amazing.
Berserk if full of small subtle symbolic scenes that I haven't mentioned,
probably many more I haven't even noticed.
Many things the characters say may appear random and meaningless, but there are few
things in Berserk that are random or unrelated.
It takes great skill and wisdom to embed such fine points, such subtleties
into an anime which is at first glance nothing more than an action story about a bunch
of mercenary warriors -- there are many anime out there that pretty much
end at the action part.
So, praise to Kentaro Miura and everybody else who contributed in making this anime.

Quite frankly, Berserk can be described with only one word -- a *masterpiece*.
