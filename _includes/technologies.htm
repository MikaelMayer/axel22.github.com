    I'm now using the <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime text editor</a>.

    I like to program in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>.
    Scala is a very nice language and its popularity is constantly growing.
    If you like Java, chances are that you will fall in love with Scala.
    So many things are so much simpler, easier, faster with it.
    Try it out.
