I am currently working on a doctorate as a research assistant in the School of Computer
and Communication Sciences at the [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch) in Switzerland,
working in the [LAMP](http://lamp.epfl.ch) laboratory on [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org)
development under the supervision of [dr. Martin Odersky](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/).
I received my Master degree at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](http://www.fer.hr/)
in Zagreb.
My research interests include programming languages, software engineering,
concurrency and parallelism.
